# jquery-server-calculator

Created a functioning calculator that runs on a function server.js file, using javascript, jQuery, node, express and body-parser. 

## Description

Webpage will have two input fields and four math operator buttons. One for plus +, minus -, divide / and multiply *. Page will check if both input fields have a number entered and an operator has been selected. If all three have been entered, it will send the input field values to the server to run put into a math equation and run the math. Then send it back to the client.

It will also print the math equation to the DOM in an unordered list. It will save this list in on the server to reuse when the page refreshes. 

There is also a button to clear the input fields. And a button to clear the history of equation being shown in the unordered list.
